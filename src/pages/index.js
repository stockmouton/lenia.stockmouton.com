                  <h2>Lenia Origins</h2>
                  <p>We are Machine Learning and Crypto enthusiasts and we believe that beyond the inherent hype, the future will be shaped by those 2 technologies.</p>
                  <p>It just happens that the beautiful subject of artificial life is a perfect medium to provide visual support for NFTs, which are also perfect to foster a community and empower more research!</p>
                  <p>Lenia are not just nice and complex mathematical animations: they are as well a research subject in the field of artificial life.</p>
                  <p>Many questions are still unanswered in this field and this project aims to help researchers answer one of the hard questions: how one can automatically and efficiently discover those mathematical creatures?</p>
                  <p>The answer lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence and requires the work of many to bear fruits! This is why we participate in the <Link href="https://openlenia.github.io/">Open Science Lenia initiative</Link> by open-sourcing AI tools to search for Lenia!</p>

                  <h2 id="dao">DAO</h2>
                  <p>We aim at building a community-run DAO for all our projects.</p>
                  <p>This collection is only the first step. You can expect us to make the project live in the long term by developing more AI x Crypto work, which will bring more value to the <Link href="#dao">DAO</Link>.</p>
                  <p>
                    The DAO gets income from:
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>50% of primary sales</b></li>
                      <li><b>2.5% of secondary sales</b> (7.5% total)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>All further decisions will be proposed and decided by the DAO after the primary sale is complete.</p>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its vision, goals, and future projects are intended to be defined by the DAO itself, as long as it keeps aligned with its values. Come discuss in our <Link href="https://discord.gg/4TFNnCkJta">Discord</Link> for more information.</p>
