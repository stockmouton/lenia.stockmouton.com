              <ul>
                <li>Lenia of this collection are OG Lenia and will be Ancestors of future Lenia. By owning an Ancestor, you will receive royalties from both primary and secondary sales of your Descendants. These royalties will be set by the <Link href="#dao">StockMouton DAO</Link>.</li>
                <li>Support AI ecosystem and research. <Link href="https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html" target="_blank">Bert Chan</Link> has been working on Lenia since 2015 and created the <Link href="https://openlenia.github.io/" target="_blank">Open Science Lenia project</Link> to push the research further. By collecting Lenia, you support directly this project.</li>
                <li>We â™¥ Science: access exclusive channels on Discord to talk about AI, Crypto, Maths and more!</li>

              <h3>DAO</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Every Lenia gives you membership to the <Link href="#dao">StockMouton DAO</Link>.</li>
                <li><b>50% of primary sales</b> are collected by the <Link href="#dao">StockMouton DAO</Link>.</li>
                <li><b>7.5% of royalties</b> on secondary sales, of which <b>33%</b> are collected by the <Link href="#dao">StockMouton DAO</Link>.</li>
                <li>All further decisions will be proposed and decided by the DAO after the primary sale is complete.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Lenia are pure mathematical creatures and a subject of active research in the field of Articifial Life.</li>
              <li>They are also gorgeous and give some kind of meditative vibes.</li>
              <li>Those Lenia are <Link href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">public domain</Link>.</li>
              <li>Open Source: everything we do is open! Check our <Link href="https://github.com/stockmouton/lenia.stockmouton.com">Github</Link></li>

            <h2>The Lenia Origins</h2>
            <p>We are Machine Learning and Crypto enthusiasts and we believe that beyond the inherent hype, the future will be shaped by those 2 technologies.</p>
            <p>It just happens that the beautiful subject of artificial life is a perfect medium to provide a visual support for NFTs, which are also perfect to foster a community and empower more research!</p>
            <p>Moreover, Lenia are not just nice and complex mathematical animations: they are as well a research subject in the field of artificial life.</p>
            <p>Many questions are still unanswered in this field and this project aim to help researchers answer one of the hard questions: how one can automatically and efficiently discovers those mathematical creatures?</p>
            <p>The answers lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence and requires the work of many to bear fruits! This is why we participates in the <Link href="https://openlenia.github.io/">Open Science Lenia initiative</Link> by opensourcing AI tools to search for Lenia! If you want to learn more about it, check <Link href="https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html">Bert Chan website</Link> or come in our <Link href="https://discord.gg/4TFNnCkJta">Discord</Link>, Morgan will be more than happy to satisfy your curiosity!</p>

            <h2 id="dao">StockMouton DAO</h2>
            <p>Beyond this NFT collection, we also aim to build a community-run DAO. Its name is <Link href="#dao">StockMouton DAO</Link></p>
            <p>This first collection is only the first step of the project, you can expect more state-of-the-art work which will bring more value to the <Link href="#dao">StockMouton DAO</Link>.</p>
            <p>Its vision, goals and future projects are intended to be defined by the DAO itself, as long as it keeps aligned with its values. Come discuss in our <Link href="https://discord.gg/4TFNnCkJta">Discord</Link> for more information</p>
