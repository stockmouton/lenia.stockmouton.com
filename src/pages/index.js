            <ul>
              <li>Lenia are pure mathematical creatures and a subject of active research in the field of Articifial Life.</li>
              <li>They are also gorgeous and give some kind of meditative vibes.</li>

            <h2>Membership Perks</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Lenia is an evolutive collection. Future Lenia will be derived from <b>Genesis Lenia</b> that will provide benefits for their owners.</li>
              <li>Every Lenia gives you <b>membership</b> to the <Link href="#dao">DAO</Link>.</li>
              <li>Support AI ecosystem and research. <Link href="https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html" target="_blank">Bert Chan</Link> has been working on Lenia since 2015 and created the <Link href="https://openlenia.github.io/" target="_blank">Open Science Lenia project</Link> to push the research further. By collecting Lenia, you support this initiative.</li>

            <h2>The Lenia Origins</h2>
            <p>We are Machine Learning and Crypto enthusiasts and we believe that beyond the inherent hype, the future will be shaped by those 2 technologies.</p>
            <p>It just happens that the beautiful subject of artificial life is a perfect medium to provide a visual support for NFTs, which are also perfect to foster a community and empower more research!</p>
            <p>Moreover, Lenia are not just nice and complex mathematical animations: they are as well a research subject in the field of artificial life.</p>
            <p>Many questions are still unanswered in this field and this project aims to help researchers answer one of the hard questions: how one can automatically and efficiently discovers those mathematical creatures?</p>
            <p>The answers lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence and requires the work of many to bear fruits! This is why we participates in the <Link href="https://openlenia.github.io/">Open Science Lenia initiative</Link> by opensourcing AI tools to search for Lenia!</p>

            <h2 id="dao">DAO</h2>
            <p>We aim to build a community-run DAO for all our projects.</p>
            <p>This collection is only the first step. You can expect us to make the project live on the long term by developing more AI x Crypto work, which will bring more value to the <Link href="#dao">DAO</Link>.</p>
            <p>The DAO gets income from:
            <ul>
              <li><b>50% of primary sales</b></li>
              <li><b>2.5% of secondary sales</b> (7.5% total)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All further decisions will be proposed and decided by the DAO after the primary sale is complete.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Its vision, goals and future projects are intended to be defined by the DAO itself, as long as it keeps aligned with its values. Come discuss in our <Link href="https://discord.gg/4TFNnCkJta">Discord</Link> for more information.</p>
